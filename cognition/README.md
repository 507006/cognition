# Introduction

Cognition&trade; is a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) solution and platform, motivated by the need to rapidly integrate,
store, index, and perform analytics on large and diverse data holdings to answer questions, inform decisions, and drive
proactive measures against adversary actions. The selection of each component is derived from our continued support to
DoD, IC, Civil, Commercial Clients, and Internal Investments. A set of data ingest and deployment tools are included as
part of the solution, enabling delivery teams to focus on developing a client solution instead of worrying about the
plumbing of data ingest, storage, and discovery.
